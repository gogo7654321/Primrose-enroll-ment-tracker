# Primrose Enrollment Manager

Digital enrollment system built for a family-owned Primrose Schools franchise that was managing everything on paper.

## What it does
- Manages student enrollment and waitlists
- Tracks tuition payments and billing
- Staff and classroom management
- Parent communication portal

## Tech Stack
- Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Hosting)
- Google Cloud Platform

## Background
I have family that Primrose franchise. The school was using paper forms and the buggy primrose website for everything - enrollment, payments, scheduling. Built this to replace that entirely. Three locations in the local franchise community now use it.

## Running locally
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
